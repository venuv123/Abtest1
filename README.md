Here, I worked to understand the results of an A/B test run by a hypothetical e-commerce website.  The analysis is a standard statistical z-test to compare two populations as well as a numerically simulated version of the statistical z-test.  Finally, a logistic regression is run to see if the new page outperforms the old page in terms of probability of converting the visitor to a customer.
